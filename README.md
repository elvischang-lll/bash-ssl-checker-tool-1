# bash-ssl-checker-tool
Very simple bash script which you could use to gain general information for the SSL certificate of a certain domain name. 

It is based on the functionality of the popular https://sslshopper.com website, but it's a command line tool.

The script has been tested on CentOS, Ubuntu, Mint and Debian.

The script provides you with the following information:

* The domain name that the SSL certificate has been issued for
* The number of days the SSL certificate expires in:
* The dates when the certificate was issued on and expires on
* The certificate has been issued by:
* Supported TLS versions
* Certificate Fingerprint

Usage:

In order to use the script just download the ssl file, make it executable and run it:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bobbyiliev/bash-ssl-checker-tool/master/ssl
chmod +x ssl
./ssl yourdomain.com
```

Output:

The output that you would get will look like this:

```
